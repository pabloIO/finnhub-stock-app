## Finnhub API React Native app by Pablo Montes Jordan

# Initialize project
To start the project, clone the project and execute:
```
    git clone https://github.com/pabloIO/finnhub-stock-app
    cd finnhub-stock-app
    npm install
    npx expo start 
```

Start the app with Android choosing the "a" option in ExpoGo or in iOS with "i", preferably start the application on Android to receive push notifications on the simulator.

To run without Expo and being able to Login with Auth0 execute the following command:

```
    npx expo run:android
    npx expo run:ios
```

Finally this is a [video](https://youtu.be/eoDn0iNHgL8) explaining how I build the app and how to run it on Android simulator to clarify technical details of its implementation. 

Thanks.
