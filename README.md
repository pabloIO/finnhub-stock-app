## Finnhub API React Native app by Pablo Montes Jordan

# Initialize project
To start the project, clone the project and execute:
```
    git clone https://github.com/pabloIO/finnhub-stock-app
    cd finnhub-stock-app
    npm install
    npx expo start 
```

Start the app with Android choosing the "a" option in ExpoGo or in iOS with "i", preferably start the application on Android to receive push notifications and being able to download it in a device.

PD.: It is also possible to run without ExpoGo with:

```
    npx expo run:android
    npx expo run:ios
```

Download the Android APK of Finnhub App in the following [link](https://expo.dev/accounts/pabloio/projects/finnhub-stock-app/builds/f4e19b5e-7c7a-4c09-9159-6eaf0b784b65)

Finally this is a [video]() explaining how I build the app and how to run it on Android device to clarify technical details of its implementation. 

Thanks
